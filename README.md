# 🍽️ Ohmyfood

**A modern redesign of a fictional restaurant pre-ordering platform, rebuilt with React, Redux, and Sass.**  
Created in 2023 as part of my front-end development studies.

---

## 🌟 Overview
Ohmyfood is a platform that allows users to browse restaurants, explore their menus, and pre-order dishes before visiting.  

Each restaurant has a dedicated menu page, with dishes sorted by category, interactive like buttons, and a responsive order summary system.

Originally built in **HTML and Sass**, this project was **fully remade with React, Redux, and Sass** to reflect my progress as a developer, with a focus on accessibility, modular architecture, and seamless UI interactions.
